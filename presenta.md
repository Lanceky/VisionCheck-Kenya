# VisionCheck Kenya - Presentation Talking Points

## 1. THE PROBLEM 🚨

**"4 million Kenyans have untreated vision problems."**

- Children labeled as "slow learners" when they simply can't see the blackboard
- Adults suffer constant headaches, reduced productivity at work
- Getting an eye screening requires:
  - Taking a full day off work
  - Traveling hours to urban centers
  - Paying unaffordable consultation fees (KES 500-2000+)
  - Waiting weeks for mobile eye camps
- **Result:** Preventable blindness, academic failure, economic loss

**Key stat:** 80% of vision impairment is preventable or treatable if caught early.
